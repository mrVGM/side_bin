# SideBin

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

You can customize **SideBin's** appearance and behavior using two optional files:

- **config.json** ‚Äì controls window size, character limit per filename, anchor point...
- **style.css** ‚Äì allows limited visual customization (e.g., colors, spacing)

Place these files in **either** of the following locations:

- The **same directory** as the application executable  
- A `.side_bin` folder in your **home directory**

> üìÅ You can find example configuration files in the `sample_config` directory of the project.

This setup gives you flexibility to apply either per-instance or user-wide settings.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build from Source

To build **SideBin** from source, follow these steps:

### 1. Build the `fs_monitor` static library (C++)

- Ensure you have **CMake** and **Clang** installed.
- Open a command prompt and navigate to the `fs_monitor` directory.
- Run the `build.bat` script to compile the library.
- After a successful build, copy `fs_monitor.lib` from the `ready` folder into `src-tauri\lib`.

### 2. Build the Tauri application

- Make sure you have the following installed:
  - **Rust**
  - **Tauri CLI**
  - A JavaScript runtime (e.g., [Bun](https://bun.sh/))

- From the project root, run:

  ```bash
  bun install
  bun run tauri build
  
After building, you'll find the compiled application in the `src-tauri/target/release` directory.
